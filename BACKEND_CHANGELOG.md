# Backend Changes Documentation
## Company Drivers, Vehicles, and Job Acceptance System

### Overview
This document outlines the backend changes made to implement company driver management, vehicle handling, and job acceptance flows. The changes build upon the existing individual transporter system while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

## 1. Company Driver Integration in Available Transporters

### What Changed
**Commit:** `8ec7afc` - Include company drivers in available transporters list

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/transporterController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `getAvailableTransporters` function to fetch both individual transporters and company drivers
- Added `getAvailableCompanyDrivers` helper function to query `companies/{companyId}/drivers` subcollections
- Company drivers now appear in FindTransporters with company details (name, logo, address)
- Transformed company driver data to match transporter format for consistency
- Added `isCompanyDriver` flag and company object for frontend identification

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Unified Search Experience**: Clients needed to see all available transporters (individual + company drivers) in one search result
- **Company Branding**: Company drivers should display company information to maintain brand visibility
- **Data Consistency**: Both types of transporters needed to appear in the same format for frontend handling
- **Scalability**: The system needed to support both individual entrepreneurs and corporate fleets

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Fetches individual transporters from transporters collection
const individualTransporters = await db.collection('transporters')
  .where('acceptingBooking', '==', true)
  .where('status', '==', 'approved')
  .get();

// Fetches company drivers from companies/{companyId}/drivers subcollections
const companiesSnapshot = await db.collection('companies').get();
for (const companyDoc of companiesSnapshot.docs) {
  const driversSnapshot = await db.collection('companies')
    .doc(companyDoc.id)
    .collection('drivers')
    .where('acceptingBooking', '==', true)
    .where('status', '==', 'approved')
    .get();
}
```

## 2. Vehicle Data Handling for Company vs Individual Transporters

### What Changed
**Commit:** `e8007f4` - Fix vehicle data handling for individual transporters vs company drivers

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Implemented different vehicle data resolution logic for individual vs company transporters
- Individual transporters: vehicle data stored in transporter document
- Company drivers: vehicle data stored in `companies/{companyId}/vehicles/{vehicleId}` collection
- Added proper vehicle data mapping when accepting bookings

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Data Architecture**: Individual transporters own their vehicles, companies own fleet vehicles
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents mixing of individual and company vehicle data
- **Scalability**: Companies can manage multiple vehicles and assign them to different drivers
- **Consistency**: Ensures correct vehicle information is displayed to clients

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Determine if transporter is company driver or individual
let isCompanyDriver = false;
let companyId = null;
for (const companyDoc of companiesSnapshot.docs) {
  const driverSnapshot = await db.collection('companies')
    .doc(companyDoc.id)
    .collection('drivers')
    .doc(transporterId)
    .get();
  if (driverSnapshot.exists) {
    isCompanyDriver = true;
    companyId = companyDoc.id;
    break;
  }
}

// Fetch vehicle data based on transporter type
if (isCompanyDriver) {
  const vehicleSnapshot = await db.collection('companies')
    .doc(companyId)
    .collection('vehicles')
    .doc(vehicleId)
    .get();
  vehicle = vehicleSnapshot.data();
} else {
  // Individual transporter - vehicle data in transporter document
  vehicle = transporter.assignedVehicle;
}
```

## 3. Job Acceptance and Booking Status Management

### What Changed
**Commit:** `ca48bc2` - Fix transporter and vehicle details in booking acceptance

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed transporter data field mapping in `acceptBooking` function
- Corrected field names to match actual transporter document structure
- Added proper vehicle data handling for both individual and company transporters
- Implemented consistent booking status updates

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Data Consistency**: Booking documents needed accurate transporter and vehicle information
- **Client Experience**: Clients needed to see correct transporter details when booking is accepted
- **Status Tracking**: Proper status updates enable real-time tracking and communication
- **Legacy Support**: Changes needed to work with existing booking data

**How It Works:**
```javascript
const updates = {
  status: 'accepted',
  transporterId: transporterId,
  vehicleId: vehicleId || null,
  // Corrected field mappings
  transporterName: transporter?.displayName || null,
  transporterPhone: transporter?.phoneNumber || null,
  transporterPhoto: transporter?.driverProfileImage || null,
  transporterRating: transporter?.rating || 0,
  transporterExperience: transporter?.totalTrips ? `${transporter.totalTrips} trips` : 'New transporter',
  transporterAvailability: transporter?.acceptingBooking ? 'Available' : 'Offline',
  transporterTripsCompleted: transporter?.totalTrips || 0,
  transporterStatus: transporter?.status || null,
  // Vehicle data from appropriate source
  vehicleMake: vehicle?.vehicleMake || vehicle?.make || transporter?.vehicleMake || null,
  vehicleModel: vehicle?.vehicleModel || vehicle?.model || transporter?.vehicleModel || null,
  vehicleYear: vehicle?.vehicleYear || vehicle?.year || transporter?.vehicleYear || null,
  vehicleType: vehicle?.vehicleType || vehicle?.type || transporter?.vehicleType || null,
  vehicleRegistration: vehicle?.vehicleRegistration || vehicle?.reg || transporter?.vehicleRegistration || null,
  vehicleColor: vehicle?.color || vehicle?.vehicleColor || transporter?.vehicleColor || null,
  vehicleCapacity: vehicle?.vehicleCapacity || vehicle?.capacity || transporter?.vehicleCapacity || null,
  acceptedAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now(),
  updatedAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now()
};
```

## 4. Notification System Improvements

### What Changed
**Commits:** 
- `0d2e385` - Fix notifications: single client notification + consistent display booking ID
- `22acb3c` - Use consistent display booking ID in notifications

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed duplicate transporter-facing notifications
- Implemented single client notification for booking acceptance
- Used consistent, user-friendly booking IDs in notifications
- Added proper notification data structure

**Why This Was Important:**
- **User Experience**: Eliminated notification spam and confusion
- **ID Consistency**: Users see the same booking ID in notifications and UI
- **Clean Communication**: Single, clear notification per booking acceptance
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent booking ID references across the system

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Use existing user-facing booking ID if available
const displayBookingId = (
  booking.displayId ||
  booking.userFriendlyId ||
  booking.unifiedBookingId ||
  booking.readableId ||
  booking.referenceCode ||
  booking.referenceId ||
  booking.bookingId ||
  booking.id ||
  bookingId
);

// Create single notification for client
await Notification.create({
  userId: booking.userId,
  type: 'booking_accepted',
  title: 'Booking Accepted! ðŸŽ‰',
  message: `Your booking #${displayBookingId} from ${booking.fromLocation} to ${booking.toLocation} has been accepted by ${transporter?.name || 'a transporter'}`,
  data: {
    bookingId: bookingId,
    displayBookingId: displayBookingId,
    transporterId: transporterId,
    transporterName: transporter?.name,
    vehicleDetails: vehicle
  },
  priority: 'high',
  actionRequired: false
});
```

## 5. Transporter Profile and Availability Management

### What Changed
**Commit:** `b5815bd` - Add transporter profile endpoint and availability toggle functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/transporterController.js`
- `backend/routes/transportRoutes.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `GET /api/transporters/profile` endpoint
- Added `PATCH /api/transporters/availability` endpoint for toggling accepting bookings
- Implemented proper transporter profile retrieval
- Added availability status management

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Profile Management**: Transporters needed to view and manage their profiles
- **Availability Control**: Transporters needed to control when they accept new bookings
- **API Consistency**: Frontend needed consistent endpoints for transporter operations
- **Status Management**: Real-time availability updates for better job matching

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Profile endpoint
app.get('/profile', authMiddleware(['transporter']), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const transporter = await Transporter.getByUserId(req.user.uid);
    if (!transporter) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Transporter not found' });
    }
    res.json(transporter);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Availability toggle endpoint
app.patch('/availability', authMiddleware(['transporter']), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { acceptingBooking } = req.body;
    const transporter = await Transporter.getByUserId(req.user.uid);
    if (!transporter) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Transporter not found' });
    }
    
    await Transporter.update(transporter.id, { acceptingBooking });
    res.json({ 
      success: true, 
      acceptingBooking,
      message: `You are now ${acceptingBooking ? 'accepting' : 'not accepting'} new bookings`
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed vehicle field mapping to match individual transporter structure
- Added default values for missing fields to prevent Firestore errors
- Removed duplicate `updateVehicle` function causing deployment crashes
- Improved vehicle creation and update handling

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Data Consistency**: Vehicle fields needed to match across individual and company contexts
- **Error Prevention**: Missing fields caused Firestore write failures
- **Deployment Stability**: Duplicate functions caused syntax errors
- **Field Mapping**: Frontend expected specific field names and structures

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Vehicle field mapping
const vehicleData = {
  vehicleMake: metadata.vehicleMake || req.body.vehicleMake,
  vehicleModel: metadata.vehicleModel || req.body.vehicleModel,
  vehicleYear: metadata.vehicleYear || req.body.vehicleYear,
  vehicleType: metadata.vehicleType || req.body.vehicleType,
  vehicleRegistration: metadata.vehicleRegistration || req.body.vehicleRegistration,
  vehicleColor: metadata.vehicleColor || req.body.vehicleColor,
  vehicleCapacity: metadata.vehicleCapacity || req.body.vehicleCapacity,
  // Default values for required fields
  status: 'active',
  createdAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now(),
  updatedAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now()
};
```

## 7. Route and Middleware Fixes

### What Changed
**Commits:**
- `87c44e1` - CRITICAL FIX: Add missing middleware to company vehicle creation route
- `456037d` - Fix route ordering issue in companyRoutes
- `31977b7` - Fix file upload issue: Use same multer config as individual transporters

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/companyRoutes.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed route ordering to prevent conflicts
- Added missing middleware to vehicle creation routes
- Aligned multer configuration with working individual transporter setup
- Removed blocking validation middleware

**Why This Was Important:**
- **Route Conflicts**: Malformed routes were intercepting requests
- **Middleware Chain**: Missing auth/multer middleware caused failures
- **File Uploads**: Consistent multer config ensured file uploads worked
- **Request Flow**: Proper middleware order enabled successful requests

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Correct route order and middleware
router.post('/:companyId/vehicles', 
  authMiddleware(['transporter']), 
  uploadAny.fields([
    { name: 'vehicleImages', maxCount: 10 },
    { name: 'logbook', maxCount: 1 },
    { name: 'insurance', maxCount: 1 }
  ]),
  createVehicle
);
```

  try {
    const { status, tripStatus } = req.body;
    const booking = await Booking.update(req.params.bookingId, {
      status: status === 'completed' ? 'completed' : 'in_progress',
      tripStatus: tripStatus || status,
      updatedAt: admin.firestore.Timestamp.now()
    });
    res.json({ success: true, booking });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
