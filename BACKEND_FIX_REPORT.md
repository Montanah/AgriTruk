# Backend Fix Report: Booking Creation 500 Error

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Booking creation was returning HTTP 500 error despite successfully creating bookings in the database.

**Root Cause**: Missing import statement in `bookingController.js`

## Technical Details

### Error Location
File: `backend/controllers/bookingController.js`  
Line: 269  
Function: `createBooking()`

### The Problem
```javascript
// Line 269 - Action.create() was being called
await Action.create({
  type: "booking_new",
  entityId: booking.bookingId,
  // ... other properties
});
```

However, the `Action` model was not imported at the top of the file:
```javascript
// Missing this import
const Action = require('../models/Action');
```

### Error Flow
1. Booking creation succeeds ✅
2. Database record is created ✅  
3. Code reaches `Action.create()` call
4. `ReferenceError: Action is not defined` ❌
5. Catch block triggers, returns 500 error ❌
6. Frontend receives error despite successful booking creation

### The Fix
Added missing import to `bookingController.js`:
```javascript
const Action = require('../models/Action');
```

## Impact
- **Before**: Bookings created but frontend showed error
- **After**: Bookings created and proper success response returned
- **User Experience**: Booking confirmation now works correctly

## Files Modified
- `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` (1 line added)

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Deployed to production backend branch

---
*This was a simple import oversight that caused a misleading error response. The booking functionality was working correctly, but the error handling made it appear broken.*
